# Simple-T-Shirt-Bot

Hello there! This is code for FRC Team 2415's Simple T-Shirts Robot. It's still a work in progress ~~so don't expect much~~ and has limited testing.

**[CATCH UP]**

It wasn't reported when available, but the robot has been capable of driving for a long time now. Just the basics with no deadband/tuning calculations to control.

**[UPDATE]**

The all 4 of the firing solenoids for the robot now trigger to release the pressurized air; however, the solenoids for accumulation are not currently wired.

**Still TODO**

<ul>
  <li>Implement deadband/tuning calcuations to improve drive control</li>
  <li>Enable single-fire and "all-fire" options for firing the barrels</li>
  <li>Implementing code for the accumulation solenoids</li>
  <li>Geneal Code lean up</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
</ul>
